# o11y Sample App

This stand-alone LWC app demonstrates the use of the `o11y` instrumentation platform. It comes with a built-in server to receive instrumentation collected on the client-side, but it can also be configured to direct traffic to a Salesforce instance.

## Try it Out

You can go to [o11y-sample-app](https://o11y-sample-app.herokuapp.com/), or deploy a copy of the app.

> Note: deploying from git.soma is not supported
